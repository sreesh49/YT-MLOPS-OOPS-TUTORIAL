1.Class and obj(example)
2.Class has data/attribute and func/methods

    *code walkthrough
    *attributes get called itself,methods are called manually

3.Why python is called oops?

   *Everything in python is an object (data structure,data type etc)

4.Advantages of oops:

   *you can create your own datatype

   *code reusability
   *debugging
   *easy to colab

5.End to End Project (chatbook class)


    *Function vs methods
    *magic method or dunter method
    *self
    *You can create attribute outside class as well

    *encapsulation
    *getter and setter
    *static method

    *Inheritance

        --Inheritance code example
        --Why inheritance is needed? (code reusability,parent has no access to child class)
        --What gets inherited?--Constructor ,Non private attributes ,Non private methods
        --Constructor overloading and method overloading
        --Super keyword (can be used only inside class,can not access variables/attributes ,used only inside child class)

        --Types of inheritance--1.Single inheritance
                                2.Multilevel
                                3.Hierarchical
                                4.Multiple <Diamond Problem>
                                5.Hybrid
